But Carragher predicted the Reds\'a0will scupper their chances with\'a0'two or three performances that leave you scratching your head'.\

Mee was being run through a series of quick-fire questions and after being asked about what defenders he looked up to the most, was pressed by Carragher for an answer on his social media debate.\
Elland Road can be a ferocious, febrile bear pit of a football stadium. But not when it\'92s half empty.\'a0\
On Monday the locals were heading for the exit with twenty minutes to go after seeing their team provide yet another shocking, stunning example of relegation football. The ones who stayed were still cheering their team on at the end but by heaven\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-11983055/THE-NOTEBOOK-Diogo-Jota-reaps-rewards-faultless-determination.html"}}{\fldrslt

This was Leeds\'92 second home shellacking in the space of a fortnight. It was 1-5 against Crystal Palace earlier this month and here it was a goal worse,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-11983161/HANDBALL-Q-Did-VAR-look-Liverpools-controversial-opener-against-Leeds.html"}}{\fldrslt

Leeds were bad under Jesse Marsch, Gracia\'92s predecessor. But they sacked the American weeks ago and haven\'92t improved. Maybe it\'92s\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-11982777/How-shape-shifters-taking-football-teams-playing-evolving-series-formations.html"}}{\fldrslt 
\f1\b \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cf4 \cb2 \strokec4 the players?}}\'a0Now there\'92s a thought.\
It is, on the face of it, astonishing that Leeds are not in the bottom three already. They have conceded 60 goals \'96 the worst in the Premier League \'96 and have won only three times in the competition since the start of November. Yet still there are four teams beneath them. So the sheer ineptitude of those even further down the food chain may yet save this great Yorkshire club. Equally, they surely will have to find some way of helping themselves.\'a0\
Todd Boehly has got some front. We should at least give him that. We should at least accept that it takes some nerve for a man who has turned\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"}}{\fldrslt 
\f1\b \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cf4 \cb2 \strokec4 Chelsea}}'s season into a sorry farrago of bombast, arrogance, stupidity and mediocrity to walk into the home dressing room late on Saturday afternoon after yet another humiliation and tell the players that their form\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-11981251/Todd-Boehly-told-Chelsea-players-woeful-form-embarrassing-Brighton-loss.html"}}{\fldrslt 
\f1\b \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cf4 \cb2 \strokec4 has been an embarrassment}}.\
An embarrassment? If there's one overarching embarrassment at Chelsea, it's Chelsea's co-owner. Most of the players, admittedly, are not far behind him. But he chose them and he paid for them.\'a0\
And then he dumped them like the contents of a supermarket sweep at the feet of a good manager,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/graham-potter/index.html"}}{\fldrslt 
\f1\b \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cf4 \cb2 \strokec4 Graham Potter}}, and blamed him because he could not make sense of the mess he had inherited.\
And then he chose\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/frank-lampard/index.html"}}{\fldrslt 
\f1\b \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cf4 \cb2 \strokec4 Frank Lampard}}\'a0\'96 a good manager and a decent man \'96 to bring some sort of order to the chaos, presumably because he thought a Chelsea legend who might just be the club's greatest ever player could act as a human shield for him and the rest of the board. That worked well.\'a0\
Boehly was pictured being harangued by fans after the defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion at the weekend. At which point, he marched into the dressing room and gave the players a 'pep-talk'.\
It has long been clear that all is not well at\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/chelsea.html"}}{\fldrslt 
\f1\b \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cf4 \cb2 \strokec4 Chelsea}}, far from ideal preparation for a Champions League quarter-final against\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/teampages/real-madrid.html"}}{\fldrslt 
\f1\b \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cf4 \cb2 \strokec4 Real Madrid}}.\
The need for co-owner Todd Boehly to deliver his own attempt to rally the troops has only added to that sense.\
Just in case\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/frank-lampard/index.html"}}{\fldrslt 
\f1\b \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cf4 \cb2 \strokec4 Frank Lampard}}'s words alone are not enough, Chelsea's players will walk out for the second leg against the holders at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday with their season on the line and a message from Boehly ringing in their ears.\
While Boehly's appearance in the dressing room following Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/brighton/index.html"}}{\fldrslt 
\f1\b \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cf4 \cb2 \strokec4 Brighton}}\'a0was not out of the ordinary, what he had to say did raise eyebrows among well-placed sources.\
After Lampard gave them a talking to \'97 and he has been clear about where his players are coming up short since he returned \'97 the American took his turn to address the squad.\
In-form forward\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/victor-osimhen/index.html"}}{\fldrslt

\f1\b \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cf4 \cb2 \strokec4 AC Milan}}\'a0in the most important match of Napoli's season.\'a0\
The Nigerian international is 100% focused and is living his moment of the season with great pressure.\'a0Against Verona, Osimhen entered the pitch in the 71st minute and hit the crossbar, making the whole stadium tremble.\
During his 20-minute cameo, Napoli's number nine repeatedly put the Veronese defense in difficulty, proving he can be the decisive man for the night of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/champions_league/index.html"}}{\fldrslt 
\f1\b \AppleTypeServices\AppleTypeServicesF65539 \cf4 \cb2 \strokec4 Champions League}}.\'a0\
The Nigerian has increased the pressure in attack and exalted the fans. The anger after the final triple whistle arose from the arbitration controversy over the referee's decision to close the match while the Neapolitans were in attack. He always wants to score and in those few seconds he wanted to score a 3-pointer.\
He helped increase the pressure in attack and brought excitement to the fans. They were eventually left frustrated after the referee blew the whistle whilst they were on the attack, with Osimhen leading it.\'a0\'a0\

The former Belgium defender is among the names under consideration at Tottenham, though Mail Sport understands there is some apprehension from some figures at the north London club about his lack of experience.\
Kompany spent two years at Anderlecht before joining Burnley ahead of the current season.\
But while there is some concern about the 37-year-old's relatively short period in management, the potential appointment of Kompany as Spurs' new long-term head coach has backing behind the scenes.\
